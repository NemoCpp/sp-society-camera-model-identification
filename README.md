`python train.py -l 5e-5 -g 2 -cs 299 -s 1 -kf` if you have two GPUs, otherwise `-g 1` and decrease batch size (do not forget to adjust `-l` if decreasing batch size)


The original work is from  https://github.com/antorsae/sp-society-camera-model-identification

I'm trying to simplify the files and adapt them to my specific hardware (an i7 for the CPU and a single GTX1080Ti for the GPU)
